			<h1> There was an attempt to make battle royale a thing in Rusted Warfare... </h1>
<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>
While being my supposedly third project, it is my second officially released mod on the game (the second project, Black X White, was just cancelled).<br><br>
Plastic Warfare was originally made in late version 1.12 and pushed forward in early version 1.13 of the game. It has most elements of battle royale genre: scattered resources, battles, inventory system, and the like. It was developed very simple. Originally, the mod has a small selection of pickable weapons and pickable items, which we will discuss later. Due to the game engine's limitations at that time, especially in 1.12, the development was halted until 1.13 arrived, which brought more flexibility in dynamic gameplay (version 1.13 was one of the biggest updates in the game, giving modders a lot of new key to play with, a lot of mechanics to fiddle.) <br> <br>
