<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>
EEE or <u><i> Electrics Excavation Exploration </i></u> is my upcoming mod, my fourth major project. It is an RTS-meets-Wiring type of mod. 90% of Rusted Warfare mods are pure RTS. Onlya fraction of total mods are those who are unorthodox in design and gameplay. <br> <br>

Originally, I've been doing several research on non-implemented mechanics by combining those who are available for modders. Rusted Warfare is basically pure RTS, so wires are not coded in its engine, although modders have suggested it. It's been a long time since I tried making wires possible, with spectacular failures. Even the game developer himself gave me a suggestion of what would be a good way to implement the system (which I did sometime ago) and make them work. In a few short days, I revealed to the community that it is really possible. I even made several related "devices" to simulate a circuit, particularly a power source and a load. <br> <br>

As for the current design state, EEE includes wiring and resource collection and classic Real Time Strategy elements. I showed several videos and images for demonstration purposes. <br> <br>

<h3> Mechanic Explanations </h3>

<h5> Wiring system </h5>
Wires, power sources, and loads uses a specific custom resources called "Current". Currents are transmitted as friendly fire, and through projectile mutators, the resource is using the projectiles. <br> <br>
</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, <u> they hit each other </u>, and only each other. Wire transmission doesn't work with allied and enemy teams. <br> <br>

Loads have variance in terms of receiving current. One-by-one loads receive their currents on their own. Two-by-two and larger loads has their integrated wires for transmission of current.

<h5> Ore Generation </h5>
There are three types of ores: Metal, Nonmetal, and Semiconductor. They are spawned on maps randomly and in an secret spawn rates. <br> <br>

<p>
When the game starts, it will look for any vanilla resource pools. There, a master resource spawner will be spawened and starts to spawn a secondary ore spawner of a specific type on a random location. Once a secondary spawner was placed, it will start to spawn their own set of ores. Sometimes, it may even spawn a tertiary spawner, which can also spawn ores. Once they finished spawning their ores, they will be removed from the game, and the ores will remain.
