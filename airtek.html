			<h1> My very first proper mod for Rusted Warfare. </h1>
	<h3> Introduction  </h3>
<p> It was made since 2018, when I managed to learn modding by reverse engineering the configuration files of the game. <br>
<br>
As my first mod, you can expect the quality at that early state. With subsequent version comes my progress in configuring units and giving them better sprites.<br>
<br>
By the 4th major update of the mod, I organized a team to further expand the mod. I called it simply as <span style="font-family: earthOrbiter;"> Airtek Industries</span> as the mod was called Airtek Mod. <br>
<br>
As year passes by, 5th update arrived. Now even better. Although some has to leave, they brought their skills for their own project, which is a good thing and I'm proud of them. Fortunately, several other modders joined the team and brought their own set of wits and skills. Until the sixth major update.<br>
<br>
The 6th major update followed a different production methodology. Instead of focusing on several branches, which are observable in previous updates, this time, we focused on a single collection of idea and released a dedicated mini-major update for them (which were called patch updates, and I know it's kinda misused.). <br>
<br>
Currently the latest patch is the 3rd patch.<br>
The fourth patch is coming soon formally. Several "Release Candidate" versions were rolled out publicly for testing purposes.

<h3> The Mod itself </h3>
<p> Download the mod on my Discord Server. Click <a href="https://discord.gg/CUbWktM"> here </a>. <br>
<br>
Airtek Mod applies most mechanics, whether built-in, or custom-made, which further improves the game. <br>
<br>
It has many units, ranging from ground moving tanks, to flying aircrafts, to sneaky submarines, to ridiculous moving machines, and more! <br>
<br>
Being a mod, users can expect superweapons, and fortunately for them, the mod has several superweapons that they can play with! <br>
